        <h2>Hi, I'm Muhannad Abushanab</h2>

            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>Honestly, I don't know how to talk about myself too much but basically, the main things about me are that
                I am twenty-two years old about to turn twenty-three I have spent some time in college and concluded that it is not for me. I stopped school for almost three years when I joined the military and
                even though that was an experience I have loved I sometimes feel like I have wasted too much time as
                most of my friends are almost done with school.</p>

            <p>While in college I took a bunch of classes that I would classify as useless such as humanities and anthropology. The only classes I honestly enjoyed and liked being in were the ones that pertained to coding.</p>

            <p>After that, I decided to try and find a way to learn coding without having to go through all the classes
                that I didn't enjoy, I have a lot of friends and family that either work or are studying to work in
                the tech industry and even though most have done it through college there are the ones who were able to
                do it without that and I'm hoping it will work out for me too. I am excited to meet others who are
                learning the same as me and working together to find solutions to different problems.</p>
